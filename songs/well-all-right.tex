\begin{verse}
Well all right so I'm being foolish
Well all right let people know
About the dreams and wishes
You wish in the night when lights are low
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Well all right Well all right
We'll live and love with all our might
Well all right Well all right
Our life time love will be all right
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
Well all right so I'm going steady
It's all right when people say
That those foolish kids can't be ready
For the love that comes their way
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
Well all right Well all right
We'll live and love with all our might
Well all right Well all right
Our life time love will be all right
\end{chorus}

\begin{chorus}
Well all right Well all right
We'll live and love with all our might
Well all right Well all right
Our life time love will be all right
\end{chorus}
