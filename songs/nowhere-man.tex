    \begin{verse}
        He's a real Nowhere Man \\
        Sitting in his nowhere land \\
        ^{F#m}Making all his ^{Am}nowhere plans for ^{E}nobody \\
        ^{E}Doesn't have a ^{B}point of view \\
        ^{A}Knows not where he's ^{E}going to \\
        ^{F#m}Isn't he ^{Am}a~bit like you and ^{E}me?
    \end{verse}
    \begin{chorus}
        Nowhere ^{G#m}Man, Please ^{A}listen \\
        You don't ^{G#m}know what you're ^{A}missing \\
        Nowhere ^{G#m}Man \\
        The ^{F#m}world is ^{A}at your command ^{B7}
    \end{chorus}
    \begin{verse}
        ^{E}He's as blind as ^{B}he can be \\
        ^{A}Just sees what he ^{E}wants to see \\
        ^{F#m}Nowhere Man, Can ^{Am}you see me at ^{E}all?
    \end{verse}
    \begin{chorus}
        Nowhere Man, Don't worry \\
        Take your time, Don't hurry \\
        Leave it all \\
        Till somebody else lends you a hand
    \end{chorus}
    \begin{verse}
        Doesn't have a point of view \\
        Knows not where he's going to \\
        Isn't he a bit like you and me?
    \end{verse}
    \begin{chorus}
        Nowhere Man, Please listen \\
        You don't know what you're missing \\
        Nowhere Man  \\
        The world is at your command
    \end{chorus}
    \begin{verse}
        He's a real Nowhere Man \\
        Sitting in his nowhere land \\
        Making all his nowhere plans for nobody \\
        Making all his nowhere plans for nobody \\
        Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
