    \begin{verse}
        Penny ^{B}Lane, there is a barber showing ^{C#m}photographs ^{F#sus4} ^{F#} \\
        Of every ^{B}head he's had the pleasure to ^{Bm}know \\
        And all the ^{Bm/G#}people that come and ^{Bm/G}go \\
        Stop and say, ^{F#sus4}hello ^{F#}
    \end{verse}
    \begin{verse}
        On the ^{B}corner is a banker with a ^{C#m}motorcar ^{F#sus4} ^{F#} \\
        The ^{B}little children laugh at him behind his ^{Bm}ack \\
        And the ^{Bm/G#}banker never wears a ^{Bm/G}mac \\
        In the ^{F#sus4}pouring rain ^{F#}, ^{E}very strange
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
        Penny ^{A}Lane is in my ^{A/C#}ears and in my ^{D}eyes \\
        ^{A}There beneath the ^{A/C#}blue suburban ^{D}sky \\
        I sit, and ^{F#}meanwhile back
    \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse}
        In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass \\
        And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen \\
        He likes to keep his fire engine clean \\
        It's a clean machine
    \end{verse}
    \begin{chorus}
        Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes \\
        A four of fish and finger pies \\
        In summer, meanwhile back
    \end{chorus}

    \begin{verse}
        Behind the shelter, in the middle of the roundabout \\
        The pretty nurse's selling poppies from a tray \\
        And though she feels as if she's in a play \\
        She is anyway
    \end{verse}

    \begin{verse}
        Penny Lane, the barber shaves another customer \\
        We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim \\
        Then the fireman rushes in \\
        From the pouring rain, very strange
    \end{verse}

    \begin{chorus}
        Penny ^{A}Lane is in my ^{A/C#}ears and in my ^{D}eyes \\
        ^{A}There beneath the ^{A/C#}blue suburban ^{D}sky \\
        I sit and ^{F#}meanwhile back \\
        Penny ^{B}Lane is in my ^{B/D#}ears and in my ^{E}eyes \\
        ^{B}There beneath the ^{B/D#}blue suburban ^{E}sky \\
        Penny ^{B}Lane
