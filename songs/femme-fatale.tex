\begin{verse}
^{Cmaj7}Here she ^{Fmaj9}comes \\
^{Cmaj7}You better watch your ^{Fmaj9}step \\
^{Cmaj7}She's going to ^{F}break your heart in ^{Dm}two, it's ^{G}true \\
^{Cmaj7}It's not hard to ^{Fmaj9}realize \\
^{Cmaj7}Just look into her ^{Fmaj9}false colored eyes \\
^{Cmaj7}She'll build you ^{F}up to just put you ^{Dm}down, what a ^{G}clown
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
'Cause everybody ^{C}knows (She's a femme ^{F}fatale) \\
^{F}The things she does to ^{C}please (She's a femme ^{F}fatale) \\
^{F}She's just a little ^{C}tease (She's a femme ^{F}fatale) \\
See the way she ^{Dm}walks \\
Hear the way she ^{Bb}talks ^{G}
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
You're written in her book \\
You're number thirty seven, have a look \\
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown \\
Little boy, she's from the street \\
Before you start, you're already beat \\
She's going to play you for a fool, yes it's true
\end{verse}
