    \begin{verse}
        There's a ^{E}port ^{B} on a ^{G#m}western ^{C#m}bay \\
        And it ^{A}serves a hundred ^{D}ships a ^{A}day \\
        Lonely ^{E}sailors ^{B} pass the ^{G#m}time ^{C#m}away \\
        And ^{D}talk ^{A}about their ^{E}homes 
    \end{verse}
    
    \begin{verse}
        And there's a girl in this harbor town \\
        And she works layin' whiskey down \\
        They say "Brandy, fetch another round" \\
        She serves them whiskey and wine
    \end{verse}
    
    \begin{chorus}
        The sailors say ^{C#m} "Brandy, you're a ^{A}fine girl" (you're a fine girl) \\
        "What a ^{C#m7}good wife you ^{A}would be" (such a fine girl) \\
        Yeah your ^{E}"eyes could steal a ^{F#m}sailor from the ^{A}sea" ^{E/G#} ^{F#m} ^{B}

    \begin{verse}
        Brandy wears a braided chain \\
        Made of finest silver from the North of Spain \\
        A locket that bears the name \\
        Of a man that Brandy loved
    \end{verse}
  
    \begin{verse}
        He came on a summer's day \\
        Bringin' gifts from far away \\
        But he made it clear he couldn't stay \\
        No harbor was his home
    \end{verse}
    
    \begin{chorus}
        The sailor said "Brandy, you're a fine girl"  (you're a fine girl)\\
        "What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl)\\
        "But my life, my love and my lady is the sea" \\

    \end{chorus}
    
    \begin{bridge}
        Yeah, ^{C#m}Brandy used to ^{B}watch his eyes \\
        When he ^{A}told his sailor's ^{B}story \\
        She could ^{C#m}feel the ocean ^{B}fall and rise \\
        She ^{A}saw its ragin' ^{B}glory \\
        ^{C#m}But he had always ^{D}told the truth, \\ ^{C#m}Lord, he was an ^{A}honest man \\
        And ^{E}Brandy does her ^{B}best to ^{A}understand ^{E/G#} ^{F#m} ^{B}

   \begin{verse}
        At night when the bars close down \\
        Brandy walks through a silent town \\
        And loves a man who's not around \\
        She still can hear him say
   \end{verse}

   \begin{chorus}
        She hears him say "Brandy, you're a fine girl" (you're a fine girl) \\
        "What a good wife you would be" (such a fine girl) \\
        "But my life, my love and my lady is the sea" \\
