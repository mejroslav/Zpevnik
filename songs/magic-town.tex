\begin{chorus}
    ^{E}They told me the streets were all paved with gold \\
    But these dirty sidewalks are gray and concrete ^{C#m7}cold \\
    ^{A}They ^{G}said neon lights were a beautiful sight \\
    But how 'bout the one blinking in \\
    My room all ^{C}night ^{E7sus4} ^{E7}
\end{chorus}    
\begin{chorus}
    And where's the ^{C#m7}ma ^{F#m7}gic in ^{Hm7}this magic ^{E}town? \\
    Where's the ^{C#m7}good ^{F#m7}life they ^{Bm7}said could be ^{E}found? \\
    Where's the ^{C#m7}ma ^{F#m7}gic to ^{Bm7}make ^{C#}all ^{D}my ^{D#m7 5b}big dreams come ^{E}true \\

    I gotta find it, girl, before I send for you \\
\end{chorus}

\begin{verse}
    ^{E}They said in this town you get rich in no time \\
	But here I am and I'm down to my last ^{C#m7}dime \\
	^{G}I just don't know why I bother to try \\
	When nobody here gives a hang \\
	If I live or ^{C}die ^{E7sus4} ^{E7}
\end{verse}

\begin{chorus}
    And where's the ^{C#m7}ma ^{F#m7}gic in ^{Hm7}this magic ^{E}town? \\
    Where's the ^{C#m7}good ^{F#m7}life they ^{Bm7}said could be ^{E}found? \\
    Where's the ^{C#m7}ma ^{F#m7}gic to ^{Bm7}make ^{C#}all ^{D}my ^{D#m7 5b}big dreams come ^{E}true \\
